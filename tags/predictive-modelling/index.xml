      <description>In this project I created a predictive machine learning model that estimates whether a specific bank customer will leave the bank. The model takes into account several features:
 The specific geographical location in Europe. Customer&amp;rsquo;s Credit Score. Estimated Salary. Gender Age Availability of Credit card Whether the customer is active.  Several models were trained, out of which an Artificial Neural Net gave the best metrics. Accuracy was chosen as a performance metric since there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much imbalance between the classes.</description>

      <title>Patient Diabetes Classifier</title>

      <description>This is the first predictive modelling project that I worked on. A classification model that predicts whether a patient is diabetic based on factors like:
 Insulin levels Blood Pressure levels Age Pregnancies (if any) Skin thickness Gender Body Mass Index  Several classification models were used. The finalized model was a Gradient Boost Classifier which gave 88% accuracy with some fine-tuning.
